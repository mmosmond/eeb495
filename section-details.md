## Topic: Contemporary evolution

Evolution by natural selection was first perceived as a slow process acting on geological timescales. This perspective has changed drastically over the last 100 years as more and more examples of rapid evolution have accumulated. Many of these examples of rapid evolution are the result of human disturbance, for example adaptation to pollution or urban environments. These studies therefore illustrate both the ability of some species to tolerate human impacts and the ability of humans to impact the evolutionary trajectory of other species. In this section of the course we will explore some striking examples of rapid evolution while developing the skills to critique and discuss science.

## Coursework

### Presentations

Each week, a group of students (i.e., the Topic Leaders) will present the context and findings of the required readings and lead the class discussion. “PowerPoint” presentations (approximately 30  minutes in total length) are encouraged. The presentations may interweave with the discussion or may occur up front, with the discussion to follow. 

### Weekly readings and written assignments

You will be required to read two papers a week: a primary research paper accompanied by a secondary paper (often a review or perspectives paper) to provide context. You will write a short critique, similar to an *Evolution* [‘Digest’ article](https://sites.duke.edu/evodigests/) on the primary paper, describing the implications and significance of the study, situating the paper in its broader scientific context, and/or suggesting future directions for related work. 

Critiques must be less than 2 pages double spaced, with 12-point Times New Roman font and 2.5 cm margins, not including references. Citations and references should be formatted according to [the style of *Evolution*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15585646/homepage/forauthors.html#ps). In-text citations are formatted as (Lastname YEAR), (Lastname1 and Lastname2 YEAR), or (Lastname et al. YEAR), depending on if there are one, two, or more authors, respectfully. 

Further details including a grading rubric and example critique will be posted on [Quercus](https://q.utoronto.ca). We will spend part of the first meeting discussing how to write an effective critique. (No assignments are due that week.) 

Students who are presenting on a given week are exempt from the written assignment. Critiques are required for only 3 of the other 4 weeks. However, if you wish to write 4  critiques, I will drop the lowest mark for the final grade. 

Critiques must be submitted through Quercus before the start of class on the day of the discussion. Critiques submitted after class will be subject to a -5% per day penalty. Please get in touch as early as possible if you foresee a problem getting a critique in on time.
