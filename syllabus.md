# Seminar in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology syllabus
### EEB 495H1S, Section L0101, Winter 2021 

## Course description 

In this course we will develop the ability to read, present, and discuss scientific literature critically. These are essential skills for every scientist (and useful skills for everyone) and can also be one of the most enjoyable aspects of science. By the end of the course we hope you will be more comfortable understanding, contextualizing, and criticizing the primary scientific literature, as well as presenting scientific ideas verbally and in writing.   

*Prerequisite*: A minimum of 1.0 FCE in EEB courses at the 300+ level (at least 0.5 FCE in ecology and 0.5 FCE in evolutionary biology is highly recommended)

## Writing help and integrity

Writing is a big part of this course. Please see the [Writing Center](https://writing.utoronto.ca/) for advice, courses, and support.  

Make sure you know how not to plagiarize. Note that it is not appropriate to use large sections of text from internet sources, and inserting a few of your own words does not make it an original piece of writing. Make sure you read material from many sources in the primary literature and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructor. See [Academic Integrity](https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/) for more information.

## Accessibility

The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. This occurs through a collaborative process that acknowledges a collective obligation to develop an accessible learning environment that both meets the needs of students and preserves the essential academic requirements of the University’s courses and programs.

Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability that may require accommodations, please feel free to email the instructors and/or the [Accessibility Services office](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/accessibility-services/).

## Religious observances

The University provides reasonable accommodation of the needs of students who observe religious holy days other than those already accommodated by ordinary scheduling and statutory holidays. Students have a responsibility to alert members of the teaching staff in a timely fashion to upcoming religious observances and anticipated absences and instructors will make every reasonable effort to avoid scheduling tests, examinations or other compulsory activities at these times.

Please reach out to me as early as possible to communicate any anticipated absences related to religious observances, and to discuss any possible related implications for course work.
