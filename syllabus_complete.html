<h2>Course description</h2>
<p>In this course we will develop the ability to read, present, and discuss scientific literature critically. These are essential skills for every scientist (and useful skills for everyone) and can also be one of the most enjoyable aspects of science. By the end of the course we hope you will be more comfortable understanding, contextualizing, and criticizing the primary scientific literature, and more comfortable presenting scientific ideas verbally and in writing.</p>
<p><em>Prerequisite</em>: A minimum of 1.0 FCE in EEB courses at the 300+ level (at least 0.5 FCE in ecology and 0.5 FCE in evolutionary biology is highly recommended)</p>
<h2>Group norms</h2>
<p>The University of Toronto is committed to equity, human rights and respect for diversity. All members of the learning environment in this course should strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect where all members of our community can express themselves, engage with each other, and respect one another&rsquo;s differences. U of T does not condone discrimination or harassment against any persons or communities.</p>

<h2>Writing help and integrity</h2>
<p>Writing is a big part of this course. Please see the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://writing.utoronto.ca/">Writing Centre</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for advice, courses, and support.</p>
<p>Make sure you <a href="https://advice.writing.utoronto.ca/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize/">know how not to plagiarize</a>. Note that it is not appropriate to use large sections of text from internet sources, and inserting a few of your own words does not make it an original piece of writing. Make sure you read material from many sources in the primary literature and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructor. See<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/">Academic Integrity</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for more information.</p>
