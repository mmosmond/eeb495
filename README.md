Materials for teaching EEB495 at the University of Toronto. 

The syllabus and section details were revised from previous versions used in the course by various professors. The html version can be pasted into Canvas.

The grading rubric was given to me by Nicole Mideo, as was the idea to write a sample critique.

The sample critique (and sample presentation) is based on Kreiner et al 2019. Multiple modes of convergent adaptation in the spread of glyphosate-resistant Amaranthus tuberculatus. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116:21076-84.
